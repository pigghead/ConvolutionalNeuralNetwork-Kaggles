# About this project
This is a continuation of my machine learning. Previously, using the MNIST dataset was provided directly from the Pytorch framework. For this project, the Kaggles Cats and 
Dogs image set was downloaded from the Internet. This was primarily a focus on working with my own dataset as well as practicing the convolution method for image processing.
